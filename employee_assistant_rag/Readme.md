    User interacts via the Streamlit Frontend

    Streamlit Frontend sends queries to FastAPI Backend

    FastAPI Backend:

        Retrieves relevant document embeddings from FAISS Vector Store

        Feeds retrieved profiles as context to LLaMA LLM

        Returns generated responses back to Streamlit

    Streamlit Frontend displays final answer to the User

AI Development Process

- Created a synthetic realistic employee dataset.

- Built natural language summaries for each employee.

- Generated embeddings using HuggingFace all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

- Stored embeddings into FAISS (IndexFlatIP) after L2 normalization.

- Set up LangChain retrieval pipeline combining vector search + LLaMA LLM.

- Designed FastAPI endpoints for chat and employee search.

- Built a simple Streamlit frontend for interaction.

- Validated response quality and system performance.

AI Tools Used:

    ChatGPT (GPT-4o) via OpenAI for:

       - Code generation

       - Explaining LangChain, FAISS, and LLaMA concepts

       - Debugging error traces and resolving integration issues

       - Architecture design suggestions for the backend and retrieval chain setup

AI vs Handwritten Code Split

   - 70% AI-assisted code ‚Äî Code snippets, module integrations, and debugging solutions suggested via ChatGPT.

   - 30% hand-written code ‚Äî Final adjustments, JSON data management, Streamlit UI structuring, and error handling logic written manually after integrating AI-generated suggestions.

Interesting AI-Generated Optimizations

   - Suggested embedding normalization using faiss.normalize_L2() to ensure cosine similarity retrieval correctness.

   - Recommended separating GET /employees/search for lightweight similarity scoring without LLaMA inference.


Future Improvements:

    Model & Embedding Improvements

        - Switch to more advanced embedding models like all-MiniLM-L12-v2, BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5, or intfloat/e5-large-v2 for better semantic search accuracy.

        - Experiment with domain-specific embeddings fine-tuned for HR and recruitment text to improve relevancy in candidate retrieval.

        - Integrate larger, more powerful models (e.g., LLaMA 3, Mistral 7B) for improved reasoning and language fluency.

        - Optimize FAISS index search parameters and experiment with other similarity metrics (e.g., Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW)) for faster retrieval on large datasets.
